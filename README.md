# reddit-auto-reply

Reddit auto reply and auto downvote.

A script which recurrsively replies to (and downvotes) comments 
by a particular author in a particular post.

Have you ever attempted to have a regular decent conversation on 
reddit like any normal human being would, only to be confronted by 
a troll, a moron, or a jerk?  Maybe this person is just genuinely 
evil.  Maybe this person just won't let you have the last word?  
It's probably because their mother didn't teach them good manners. 

This script could enable you to repetitively shut this person down 
without even having to spare them even a single thought. 

This is a mostly untested sript.  I only wrote it to end a certain 
conversation.  It did a fine job at that, and it kept me from having 
to waste any more time replying to that thread.  I fed the script
a reply that made it quite clear that the person that I was replying 
to was deficient in their mental capacities and that I had written 
this bot to automatically reply to anything they wrote in my thread.
It worked perfectly.  After a few rounds of interacting with my 
reply bot, that person finally realized that they would never have
the last word.  They moved on and dug a little deeper into their
troll hole.  Good riddance.
